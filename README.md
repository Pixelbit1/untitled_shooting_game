=====================================
(Visit my github at github.com/Pixelbit1)
YOU WILL NEED PYGAME TO RUN THIS PROGRAM (visit pygame.org for more information)

This game isn't intended to be good, just something I made in my free time
In total, this program took about 3 hours to make

The objective of the game is to get as high of a score as possible
Use WASD/Arrow keys to move.
Clicking on an enemy will cause it to disappear and the score on the top right to go up
You have 10 bullets (indicated by the top left). If you run out of bullets, you cannot shoot anymore.
If you have less then 10 bullets, you can push R to reload.
You can hold LShift or RShift to slow down your movement

Programs used:
Thonny
GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)
Pygame

Feel free to do whatever you want with this code, just make sure to credit me.
